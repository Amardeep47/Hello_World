# Hello_World

Hello everyone!!

Amar here, I like the python language as it interpreted language, so basically its easy to resolve any errors.
Python is indeed a language very useful for data analytics and data science.
However, I plan to R programning language meant for data analytics.

GitHub tool plays an important role as a data analyst. Its advised to all Data analyst to learn github along with tools.

Amar.
